This directory contains basic functions which are useful for other
software. That is why I have put it in a seperate directory.

cleanMUMcand.c: cleaning tables of MUM candidates
clock.c: timing the program
debug.c: throwing debugging messages
distri.c: incrementally computing distributions of integers
mapfile.c: memory mapping files
multiseq.c: handling multiple sequences
procopt.c: parsing options
safescpy.c: a safe string copy
seterror.c: handling error messages
space.c: space allocation and keeping track of it
